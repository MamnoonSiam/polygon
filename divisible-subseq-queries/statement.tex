Name: Divisible Subsequences Queries


Legend
=============================

You are given an integer array $a$ of length $n$ and $q$ update/queries. If
it's an update, you'll be given two integers $i$ and $x$, meaning you have to
update $a_i$ with $x$. And if it's a query, you'll be given two integers $l$
and $r$, for which you need to find the number of subsequences of $a[l\ldots
r]$ which have their sum divisible by $k$ (given in the beginning and is
fixed throughout the rest of the eternity).


Input Format
=============================

The first line contains three space separated integers $n$, $k$ and $q$ $(1
\le n, q \le 100000, 1 \le k \le 10)$.

The second line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots,
a_n$ $(0 \le a_i < k)$.

Next $q$ lines contains three space separated integers, each starting with
the integer $T$ $(T \in \{1, 2\})$.

If $T = 1$, it's an update and the next two integers will be $i$ and $x$ $(1
\le i \le n, 0 \le x < k)$.

If $T = 2$, it's a query and the next two integers will be $l$ and $r$ $(1
\le l \le r \le n)$.

Output Format
=============================

For each of the query event, print the number of desired subsequences.
